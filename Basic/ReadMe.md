### DATA vs TYPES 
- **DATA** is used to declare variables where memory is allocated and values can be stored.
- **TYPES** is used to define data types or structures without allocating memory, so no value is stored.


   #### What is Elementary Data Types
 - elementary data types are used to store single values such as text, numbers, and amounts.
- Examples include character, numeric text, integer, packed number, and string.
- Character type stores fixed-length text, integer is used for whole numbers and calculations, numeric text stores only digits but is not used for calculations, packed number is mainly used for currency and decimal calculations, and string is a dynamic type used for long text.
